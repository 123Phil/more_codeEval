# more_codeEval
I started doing CodeEval challenges again... gotta get back in the top 100

Most of these are in Python 2.
CodeEval has improved their Python 2 interpreter, so it does not consume a lot
of memory - which means easy coding can get scores on par with C/C++ code.

The Python 3 on the site still uses a ton of memory, so scores drop noticably.
Some of these are in C/C++, mostly when doing a lot of array access or byte
level iteration.

Suprisingly, CodeEval does not have NumPy installed...
It's not that handicapping, it just caught me off-guard after doing a math-
heavy challenge using numpy, only to convert back to vanilla Python.
